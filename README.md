## My process

Built a simple website with mobile-first view, then used media queries to make it responsive for desktop. Also used Javascript and React to making it dynamic.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- ES6 Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot of things, like use of position and display in css.
Also learned lot of other css properties which were not known to me earlier like overflow, transform etc.
Also implemented my knowledge of React.js

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: black;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
